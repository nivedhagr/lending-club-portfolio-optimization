# ü§ñ Update 2: Predictive Modeling & Investment Strategies

**Phase 2 of Lending Club Portfolio Optimization: Advanced Machine Learning for Default Prediction and Return Forecasting**

## üéØ Phase Overview

Building on the clustering insights from Update 1, this phase develops sophisticated predictive models for both default prediction and return forecasting. The analysis combines multiple machine learning approaches with data-driven investment strategies, achieving breakthrough performance including a 21.87% return strategy with 0% defaults.

## üèÜ Key Deliverables

### **Primary Objectives Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ **Default Prediction Models:** Built and compared 5+ ML models for loan default prediction
- ‚úÖ **Return Forecasting:** Developed XGBoost model for return prediction (R¬≤ = 0.33)
- ‚úÖ **Signal Leakage Prevention:** Ensured all models use only application-time features
- ‚úÖ **Investment Strategies:** Created 4 custom strategies outperforming baseline approaches
- ‚úÖ **Model Validation:** Comprehensive performance testing across multiple metrics

## üî¨ Technical Methodology

### **1. Signal Leakage Prevention & Data Integrity**

#### **Critical Problem Identified:**
- **Signal Leakage:** Using information unavailable at investment time (e.g., loan recoveries)
- **Impact:** Models achieved near-perfect accuracy but were unrealistic for real-world application
- **Solution:** Restricted to application-time features only

#### **Data Preparation:**
- **Feature Filtering:** Removed all post-application variables
- **Temporal Validation:** 2014 training, 2015 testing for time-aware validation
- **Class Balancing:** Addressed severe class imbalance (few defaults in original data)
- **Feature Set:** Final dataset with borrower-supplied information only

### **2. Default Prediction Modeling**

#### **Models Evaluated:**
- **Logistic Regression:** Baseline interpretable model
- **Decision Tree:** Rule-based approach with business interpretability
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble method for improved performance
- **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting for maximum predictive power
- **Gradient Boosting:** Alternative boosting implementation

#### **Model Performance Comparison:**
| Model | AUC Score | Recall (Default) | Accuracy | Key Strength |
|-------|-----------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| **XGBoost** | **0.6631** | **0.51** | 0.65 | **Best overall performance** |
| Random Forest | 0.6425 | 0.53 | 0.64 | Balanced metrics |
| Logistic Regression | 0.6380 | 0.58 | 0.63 | High interpretability |
| Decision Tree | 0.6210 | 0.59 | 0.61 | Business rule extraction |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.6180 | 0.01 | 0.82 | High accuracy, poor recall |

#### **Model Selection Rationale:**
- **XGBoost:** Selected for deployment due to highest AUC and solid recall
- **Logistic Regression:** Retained for interpretability and transparency
- **Key Insight:** Recall for defaults is critical in lending; accuracy alone is misleading

### **3. Feature Importance & Business Rules**

#### **Top Risk Predictors Identified:**
1. **Term > 60 Months:** Strongest default predictor (+0.3584 coefficient)
2. **Debt-to-Income Ratio:** Higher DTI increases risk (+0.1650 coefficient)
3. **Recent Credit Inquiries:** Indicates credit stress (+0.1363 coefficient)
4. **Small Business Loans:** Higher risk category (+0.0953 coefficient)
5. **Revolving Utilization:** Credit card maxing indicator (+0.1041 coefficient)

#### **Protective Factors:**
1. **Annual Income:** Higher income reduces risk (-0.1786 coefficient)
2. **Revolving Balance:** Larger balances indicate capacity (-0.1547 coefficient)
3. **Mortgage Ownership:** Stability indicator (-0.0838 coefficient)

#### **Business Rules Extracted:**
- **High Risk:** Revolving utilization >61.75% AND revolving balance ‚â§$2,063
- **Low Risk:** DTI ‚â§21.23% AND annual income >$65,046
- **Term Risk:** 60-month loans significantly riskier than 36-month terms

### **4. Return Prediction Modeling**

#### **Return Metric Selection:**
- **Tested:** ret_PESS, ret_OPT, ret_INTa, ret_INTb, ret_INTc
- **Selected:** ret_INTc (intermediate return with 0.5% reinvestment assumption)
- **Rationale:** 
  - Highest average return (7.99%)
  - Low downside risk
  - Fewer outliers than optimistic return
  - More realistic than pessimistic return
  - Investor-friendly assumptions

#### **Return Prediction Performance:**
- **Best Model:** XGBoost with R¬≤ = 0.33, RMSE = 0.0516
- **Key Finding:** Tree-based models significantly outperformed linear models
- **Business Impact:** Application-time features hold meaningful predictive power

## üìà Investment Strategy Development

### **1. Baseline Strategy Performance**

#### **Simple Strategies Tested:**
| Strategy | Mean Return | Std Dev | Default Rate | Risk-Return Profile |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Random Selection | 7.97% | 6.37% | 19.0% | Baseline benchmark |
| Low Default Probability | 6.76% | 2.94% | 5.0% | Conservative approach |
| High Predicted Return | 9.58% | 10.07% | 29.0% | Aggressive approach |

#### **Key Insights:**
- High return strategy achieved best returns but with extreme risk
- Low default strategy provided stability but limited upside
- Random selection served as effective baseline for comparison

### **2. Custom Strategy Development**

#### **Strategy Performance Summary:**
| Strategy | Description | Mean Return | Std Dev | Default Rate | Key Advantage |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Strategy 4** | Last-Minute High-Income Clean Borrowers | **21.87%** | **0.14%** | **0.0%** | **Best overall** |
| Strategy 2 | Consistent High-Grade Loans | 12.12% | 0.18% | 0.0% | Maximum safety |
| Strategy 3 | Hybrid (1-Default) √ó Return | 17.28% | 4.39% | 3.0% | Balanced approach |
| Strategy 1 | Best in Interest Rate Bin | 16.44% | 4.09% | 0.0% | Smart diversification |

#### **Strategy 4: Breakthrough Performance**
- **Achievement:** 21.87% returns with 0% defaults
- **Method:** Focus on high-income borrowers with clean credit profiles
- **Scalability:** Maintained performance across portfolio sizes
- **Business Impact:** Demonstrates potential for exceptional risk-adjusted returns

### **3. Scalability Analysis**

#### **Portfolio Size Testing:**
- **Sizes Tested:** 20, 100, and 1,000 loan portfolios
- **Key Findings:**
  - Hybrid and Last-Minute strategies maintained highest returns (~20-22%)
  - Hybrid strategy: 0% defaults even at 1,000 loans
  - Interest Rate Bin strategy: Consistent ~15% returns across scales
  - High-Grade strategy: Safe but declining returns with size

#### **Scalability Recommendations:**
- **Large Portfolios (1,000+ loans):** Hybrid or Interest Rate Bin strategies
- **Medium Portfolios (100-500 loans):** Strategy 4 for maximum returns
- **Small Portfolios (20-100 loans):** Last-Minute for gains, High-Grade for stability

### **4. Temporal Validation & Model Degradation**

#### **2014-2015 Performance Analysis:**
- **Training (2014):** Hybrid strategy achieved 17-21% returns, ~3% defaults
- **Testing (2015):** Performance degraded to 8.31% returns, 31% defaults
- **Volatility Increase:** Standard deviation jumped to 10.22%

#### **Key Learnings:**
- Model patterns didn't hold across years
- Borrower behavior and lending criteria evolved
- Demonstrates need for time-aware validation and frequent retraining
- One year of data insufficient for robust model development
